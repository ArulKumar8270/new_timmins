                        Agile is no longer a team-level framework — it’s an enterprise strategy.

                        The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe®) brings agility to complex, multi-team
                        environments such as engineering, IT, operations, and product development.

                                Most SAFe® certifications take 2–3 days of training followed by an
                                online exam.
