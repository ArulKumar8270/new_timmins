                <h2>Why Scaled Agile (SAFe®)?</h2>
                <p><strong>Agile is no longer a team-level framework, it’s an enterprise strategy.</strong></p>
                <br />
                <p>The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe®) brings agility to complex, multi-team environments such as engineering, IT, operations, and product development. SAFe® helps organizations:</p>
                <ul className="outcomes-list">
                    <li>align teams around shared objectives</li>
                    <li>improve delivery predictability and speed</li>
                    <li>remove organizational silos</li>
                    <li>empower leaders with data-driven insights</li>
                    <li>scale Agile across portfolios, programs, and engineering teams
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    This is why SAFe® has become the global standard for large-scale transformation across industries.
